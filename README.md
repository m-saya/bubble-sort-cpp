# Bubble Sort in C++

This project demonstrates a simple Bubble Sort implementation in C++.

## What the program does
- Generates 100 random integers between 0 and 999  
- Sorts the numbers using a basic O(n²) bubble sort  
- Prints the sorted numbers in rows of 10  

## Purpose
This was one of my first C++ learning exercises in university.  
It helped me understand:
- arrays  
- loops  
- nested loops  
- swapping values  
- sorting logic  

## How to compile
You can compile the program using g++:
